            <p class="seContent">Do you have what it takes to dissolve an audience in an ocean
                of emotions and actions? The colourful lights, cameras & the
                audience are waiting for you. If you can make your expressions
                to the next level, then this is where you belong. The stage is
                set and waiting for your next grand act.

                <p class="seContent">In civilised life, where the happiness,    
                and indeed almost the existence, of man, 
                depends so much upon the opinion of his fellow men,
                 he is always acting a studied part. In a Mono Act,
                 an actor is vulnerable. His total personality is 
                 exposed to critical judgment - his intellect, his
                bearing, his diction, his whole appearance. If you
                can reveal your emotions in front of the audience,
                your chance.

                <p class="seContent">In this fast developing world, very few people
                     have a natural taste for drama. If you can
                     catch the attention & attract people to stay
                     and watch your performance, here is your chance.
                     The art of grabbing the audience’s attention is
                     all that you need. No lights, no mics, only pure 
                    ACTION full of energy.

                    the sound was finding it very difficult to escape, 
                    those creatures in the shades of black and white were
                     making statements with their mouth stitched and were 
                     gradually paving the path for the crowd to dive deep 
                     into the sea of joyride full of laughter and emotions. 
                     Reliving those golden days when Charlie Chaplin and 
                     Marcel Marceau ruled, at Kashiyatra unfurl their hidden
                     soul beneath you and let your mime do the chatters that
                     won’t stop ever.
