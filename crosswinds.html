            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p class="seContent">Crosswindz, the oldest battle of bands in India, 
                is one of the Flagship events of Kashiyatra. Since its inception, 
                Crosswindz has been home to major rock bands in India. Mindshift 
                (Sweden), Tiny Fingers (Israel), Demonic Resurrection (Mumbai), 
                Undying Inc (Delhi), Albatross (Mumbai), Underground Authority 
                (Kolkata) have been our past headliners. Some of the past winners 
                include Escape Artist, Diabolical Damage, High Frequency and the 
                Purple Jays. Like the previous year, this year Crosswindz will 
                organise a road trip for multi-city elimination rounds to ensure 
                high-quality participation from bands all over the nation leading 
                to a tight battle to be the best. After the road trip selected 
                bands will compete in the finals to be held in Varanasi. The finals 
                will be the opening act for headliners followed by the announcement
                 of results.
